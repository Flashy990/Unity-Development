# EscapeMasterGame
Be sneaky and try to get to the finish point without being spotted by the guards. 
Inspried by Sebastian Lague but in first person mode and with my own spin.
# TODO
1) Add animations and textures.
2) Add auto map generation
3) Add difficulty levels. (Different difficulties would be achieved by changing the number of guards and their behaviours like spotting distance, speed, map coverage, etc)
