# Procedural-World-Generation
Learning procedural world generation to then implement it in my independent game development porject.
- This is still unfinished and I am working on it from time to time.
- The goal is to learn all the ins and outs of procedural world generation and be able to use this knowledge to create a level that is interesting for the player to explore and play in.
